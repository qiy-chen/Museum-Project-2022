# Plan

We plan to do white-box testing for the unit tests and integration tests.

## For each unit test

We plan to have 95% coverage on all essential lines of the service class that it is testing.

We plan to test 90% of the branches present in the service class that it is testing.

## For each integration test

We plan to have 95% coverage on all essential lines of the service and controller classes that it is testing.

We also plan to test 90% of the possible branches in the service and controller classes that it is testing. The branch which leads to a successful operation must be covered by the test.
