# Plan

We plan to do white-box testing for the unit tests and integration tests.

#### For each unit test

We plan to have at least 95% coverage on all essential lines of the service class that it is testing on.

We plan to test at least 90% of the branches present in the service class that it is testing on.

#### For each integration test

We plan to have at least 95% coverage on all essential lines of the service class and controller class that it is testing on.

We also plan to test at least 90% of the possible branches in the service class and controller class that it is testing on. The branch which leads to a successful operation must be covered by the test.
