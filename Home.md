## Project Overview
Welcome to the repository for the Museum Management System, a software and website that's helping local museums help you! 

Our software will support accounts for visitors, museum employees and the admin and provides state of the art scheduling services to regulate employee shifts and museum visiting hours. Our website will allow viewing of all artwork in the museum, will support artwork loans. Employees will be able to use the website to track artwork placement through the museum rooms and in the storage. The admin will have unique functionalities to give them control over employee management.

The Museum Management System development team is comprised of six skilled software engineers collaborating on state of the art project management and version control platform.
