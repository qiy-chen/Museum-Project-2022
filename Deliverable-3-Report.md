## Key Design Decisions
Our group used free online templates to kickstart our html page designs. We chose to complete the html files before conversion into .vue files since vue accepts html code. We use JS to monitor some routing. For example, JS enables there to be just one login page and button, then the highest role for a person logging in determines what page they are lead to. We decided to provide access to each service using seperate dashboards to centralize the services available to customers, employees, and the admin. We added a calendar to visualize the shift schedules using open source code from GitHub. We also decided to visualize key information in tables such as the loans, tickets, and artworks.
